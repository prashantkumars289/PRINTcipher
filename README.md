Files with discription:
1) implementation_codebreaker.cpp : We have implemented all 48 rounds of PRINTcipher-48. Simply run the program with the given plaintext, you will get the 
    ciphertext after each round. Also, you can uncomment the print (cout) statement in between the code to see intermediated steps. To verify the result,
    we have attached a verify_PRINTcipher_48.png file which is taken from a research paper named "PRINTcipher: A Block Cipher for IC-Printing"
    (link: https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-642-15031-9_2).
